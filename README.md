## A fully functioning Cookie Clicker game with a running cookie count that can be increased and decreased with a cps that changes too.

This project was completed as part of an assignment in the Software Development Bootcamp, where we applied what we learned in class over a few days to create something tangible: a functional and easy-to-play game. The following briefly explains how the game was created:

- Multiple React elements were used, such as props, events, useEffect, and useState.
- CSS styling was applied to elevate the UI when playing the game.
- The concept of the game is simple, but getting it fully functioning took a lot of debugging.
